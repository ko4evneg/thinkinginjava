//Exercise 13: (1) Verify the statements in the previous paragraph.

//The static initializers for Cups run when either the access of the static object cup1 occurs on the
// line marked (1), or if line (1) is commented out and the lines marked (2) are uncommented. If both
// (1) and (2) are commented out, the static initialization for Cups never occurs, as you can see from
// the output. Also, it doesnâ€™t matter if one or both of the lines marked (2) are uncommented;
// the static initialization only occurs once.

// Constructor wasn't called as new keyword hasn't been used.
