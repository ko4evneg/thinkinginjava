//Exercise 17: (2) Create a class with a constructor that takes a String argument. During construction,
//print the argument. Create an array of object references to this class, but donâ€™t actually create
//objects to assign into the array. When you run the program, notice whether the initialization messages
//from the constructor calls are printed.

//Exercise 18: (1) Complete the previous exercise by creating objects to attach to the array of
//references.
