//Exercise 4: (2) Add a new type of Shape to Shapes.java and verify in main( ) that polymorphism works for your new
//type as it does in the old types.

//Exercise 31: (3) Modify polymorphism/shape/RandomShapeGenerator.java to make it Iterable. Youâ€™ll need to add a
//constructor that takes the number of elements that you want the iterator to produce before stopping. Verify that it
//works.
